# ECOMMERCE-SALES-DASHBOARD
The "Analyzed E-commerce Sales Dashboard" project involved the creation of an interactive dashboard using Power BI to visualize and analyze sales data from an e-commerce platform. The primary objective was to provide stakeholders with actionable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends. I began by importing and transforming raw sales data, ensuring it was clean and structured for analysis. The dashboard features key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, average order value, and conversion rates, along with visualizations like bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to illustrate sales trends over time and by product category. Additionally, I incorporated filters that allow users to segment data by region, time period, and customer demographics, enabling deeper insights into purchasing patterns. This project not only enhanced my skills in data visualization and Power BI but also demonstrated the power of data-driven decision-making in optimizing e-commerce strategies and improving overall business performance.
